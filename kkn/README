Topic 3.4: Recommender system using collaborative filtering

I predict the movie ratings on the MovieLens Data Sets.
You can download the datasets (ml-100k.zip) from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/
After unzip this file, the 'u.data' is the target data set I use under the folder of ml-100k

Due to the submission space limitation, datasets is available on https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o7u8922vra6m59g/AAB942kWzPsd1k5R5WEmDXPpa?dl=0
You can download and treat 'u.data' as dataset.

Dataset: 'u.data' contains four columns, I treat first column as user ids, second as movie ids and third column as ratings. The fourth column is ignored.

'sys' is imported to exit system in case of inputting an invalid user id or movie id.
'math' is imported to do mathematic calcualtion on pearson correlation coefficient
'matplot' is import to draw the result
'pandas' is imported to read and split dataset only


Process:
1. Process data. process_trainning_data(dataset) is implemented to gain the userlist
2. input a valid user id to be predict(e.g. 1, 214), valid means the user id input exists in first column of dataset. user_id_check(user_predicted, userlist) is a checking function.
3. input a valid movie id to be predict(e.g. 20, 141),  valid means the user id input exists in first column of dataset. movie_id_check(movie, userlist) is a checking function.
4. get nearest neighbours by function of nearest_neighbours(user_predicted, userlist)
5. predict ratings by function of predict(n_nearest_neighbour, movie, userlist)
get the result of ratings
6. split dataset as 80% train data and 20% test data
7. use 200 sample tests to predict ratings by repeat 4-5 and get accuracy of this system by using accuracy(userlist, test, n, knn)
8. change number of nearest neighbours(knn) to get a series of accuracy. k=[100, 200, 300, 400]
9. plot the result with matplotlib.

The program will output the ratings you predict, if input user id and movie id are valid(exists in dataset)
and a figure show different accuracies influenced by different knn.
